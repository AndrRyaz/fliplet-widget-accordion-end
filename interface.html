  <h2><small>How to use</small></h2>
  <p>This is one of a 2-part component:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Accordion heading</li>
    <li>End of Accordion <strong>(this component)</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <p>An accordion group is a group of collapsable accordions, each collapsable accordion is created by an Accordion heading component, and you finish the accordion group by adding the End of Accordion component at the end of all the Accordion heading components. Using this method you can create several accordion groups with one or more collapsable accordions.</p>
