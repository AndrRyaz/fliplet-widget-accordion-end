  <p>This component is one of 2 components youâ€™ll require to form an expanding accordion:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Accordion heading</li>
    <li>End of Accordion <strong>(this component)</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Insert the Accordion Heading component first, give it a name, and then go back to your app screen. Hit enter after the heading and add all content you would like to be inside the accordion directly underneath the Accordion Heading. When all the content has been added, add a bottom end to your accordion with this component. Repeat for any further accordions you may want.</p>
